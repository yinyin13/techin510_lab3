## Lessons Learned
- I'm now more familiar with using SQL clauses
- I learned how to create interactive UIs using Streamlit
- I learned the basics of CSS and HTML commands

## Future Improvements for the App
- Add a feature that allows users to practice using the vocabulary word
- Change the `update_progress` logic so that users can directly update their learning progress without filling the form again
- Add a calendar feature for users to better track their learning progress
- Improve overall UI and usability
